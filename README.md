Hi! <br />
I started [Greenfox Academy's](https://www.greenfoxacademy.com/) bootcamp in April 2019 to become a junior software developer.<br />
In this repo you can see all the work I did there, how I grew better and better as a coder, and you can have a brief understanding of the pace we were learning at.<br /> <br />
Please feel free to roam around.<br /> <br />
If you are a fellow Greenfox student in one of the following cohorts, I hope this repo will help you keeping up. I tried to keep it as nice and tidy as possible.
